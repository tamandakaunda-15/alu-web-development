In this and coming projects,I am going to  implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, I will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

This designer file will be available on Figma - I just  created an account to access the final result here:

Page in Figma
fig file
And I  “Duplicated to my Drafts” to have access to all design details.



Important notes with Figma:

 one can find missing fonts here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float -   round them
